# Introduction

This repo contains all graded work done by me (Shafiq al-Shaar) for the course of "[Bioinformatics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics)" given by University of California San Diego.

# Tools used

1. Python3 - language used in implementing the course work / code challenges.

2. OneNote - for note taking.

3. AnkiApp - for creating flash cards.

# My background

1. My qualifications are 6 IGCSEs and TOEFL.

2. Couldn't continue A-Levels / University due the responsbility of taking care of my siblings.

3. I'm an IT software developer having done pretty large projects.

4. I was always fascinated of the bioinformatics realm since I first heared of it in 2012 on Reddit.

5. I'm hoping to go back to university after taking the Bioinformatics Specialization course.
